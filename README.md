To migrate your Planetcale database to Supabase, follow these steps:

    Deploy the latest version of your "yours-sincerely" project with the Supabase URL.
    Run the command "npm run convert" to convert the following models: "User," "Account," "Block," "EnrolledEvent," "Prompt," and "Token".
    Finally, execute "npm run post_convert" to convert the models "flag," "post," and "like".
